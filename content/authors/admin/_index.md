I am a MSc student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at 
Xi'an Jiaotong University since September 2019. I obtained my Bachelor’s Degree 
in the Department of Mathematics at Jilin University in June 2019.

My research interests lie in the general area of complex data analysis, particularly in Longitudinal and Functional data analysis. My previous research includes robust statistics and complex correlation structures in Longitudinal data modelling.
My current research focuses on High-dimensional data analysis. I am also exploring online optimization and robustness in Machine Learning.
